/**
 * Second layer to Jitter providing higher level functionality based on receiving processed input from JitterListener.
 * Buffers the input read at "Leap FPS" for easy consumption at a lower "Application FPS" without missing frames.
 * Application-specific implementations can simply request batched data through very exact method calls.
 * Some methods additionally support filtering the batched data further.
 *
 * General design notes:
 * Leap gestures come in three stages - started, updated, stopped. Discrete gestures only have the stopped state.
 * - Started: first frame making up a continuous gesture. Add it to the buffer since we know it is brand new.
 * - Updated: later frame in a continuous gesture. Replace any existing buffer entry with the latest frame.
 *      If a gesture can be "consumed" by use in an implementation then it gets removed and is ignored if seen again.
 * - Stopped: final/only gesture frame. Unless already consumed add/overwrite in buffer and remove from "consumed" list.
 *
 * Buffers are filled by calls coming from JitterListener and are consumed by calls to the batch return methods.
 * Those methods may be picky and not accept all buffered gestures and should remove "stopped" gestures from the buffer.
 *
 * To hide more technical Leap details this class could offer "user friendly" gesture enabling methods that include
 * details on the minimum sensitivity of gestures as well as whether said gestures are "consumed" when returned.
 *
 * Based on gesture_recognition.pde by Marcel Schwittlick for LeapMotionP5 - https://github.com/mrzl/LeapMotionP5
